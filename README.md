# Swim-Nationals
## Overview 
This program aims to assist swimming coaches in registering their athletes for competitions. When coaches have a large group of athletes competing in different races, they must devote a significant amount of time to organizing and registering each athlete and their strokes for the event. However, this project simplifies the process by using a Google Sheet, to store user information where athletes can choose what they want to swim, and coaches can then register them for the competition.

National competitions are one of the most important events, as athletes strive to perform their best. To participate, athletes must meet the minimum requirements, which include qualification times. Each country has its criteria for determining these times. For example, in Germany, the qualification times are based on the 40 fastest swimmers in each stroke and distance. The 40th place time from the previous year is used as an estimate for the following year. Therefore, even if an athlete swims at a similar time to the previous year's 40th place, there is no guarantee that they will qualify for the event.

This project provides swimmers with an estimate of the qualification time required for each stroke and distance at national competitions. It also helps coaches save valuable time by simplifying the bureaucratic process of registering their athletes for competitions.

## User Goals:

* Develop an intuitive and user-friendly program to select swimming events.
* Provide clear instructions for users on how to enter values.
* Highlight important information for a better user experience
* Update the Orders data sheet with accurate values
* Display the qualification time and other variables chosen by the user

## User Stories:

* As a user, I want to view the qualifying times for different events and distances
* As a user, I want to personalize the response with my data.
* AS a user, I want to be able to choose as many events as I like.

## Scope:

* Show users their options
* Display warnings for incorrect input formats
* Gives a qualifying time depending on the gender, stroke, and distance
* The program appends the user's choices to the sheet.

## Flowchart

Lucidchart was used to creating the Flowchart for my program, helping visualize the steps that the program does.

<br>

#### What to do next?
* User is given the option to select another event or to exit the program.
* Only (Y/N) are valid, any other letter will display an error.
* When key "Y" is pressed the user is redirected to the name section.
* When key "N" is pressed a see you soon message is printed.

### Future Features
* Select more than one event at the same time
* Let the user's qualification time be compared with the user's actual swimming time.

## Bugs
<hr>

After presenting the list of swimming events, the user is asked to input their preferred stroke and distance. However, the program currently only confirms the user's selection after they have entered both pieces of information, even if one or both are incorrect. For example, if the user correctly selects the stroke but enters an incorrect distance, the program will only notify them of the error after they have also entered their gender.

To address this issue, a possible solution would be to limit the user's stroke and distance choices to a pre-defined set of options, like the one in the dictionary attributing a key for distances and values to strokes. This would ensure that the user only enters valid combinations of stroke and distance, and would reduce the likelihood of errors or confusion.

## Technologies Used
* Gspread
* Colorama
* google.oauth2.service_account
* Gitpod
* GitHub
* Heroku
* Lucidchart
* PEP8


## Testing
* PEP8 code validator was used to find and eliminate issues.
* When invalid inputs are entered, the program returns until the expected ones are selected.
* Tested multiple times to showcase hypothetical user's details being printed to the sheet. 
* Tested in combination with my mentor. Bugs are reported in the section above. 

### Validator Testing
* PEP8, all errors fixed.

## Deployment
Steps to deployment were followed from Code Institute learning material.
<br>

* Sign in to your Heroku account.
* Access the main page and click the "New" button in the top-right corner. Choose "Create New App" from the drop-down menu.
* Choose a unique name for your app and select the region.
